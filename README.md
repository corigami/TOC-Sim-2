# TOC-Sim-2
Theory of Constriants Simulator v2. 

## Purpose

The project will allow the user to simulate various pre-defined "production" scenarios or define their own.  The simulate consists of
a group of nodes linked together in a production line.  Each node has its on characteristics that define how much it can produce and 
how many resources it needs to consume to produce its output.

This is a project that I'm starting again to try to improve the orginal ToC Sim that was never finished.  This is just a pet project
for the sole purpose of refreshing my web programming and design skills while I'm deployed.

## Background 
The first attempt lacked any real design process and was just coded ad-hoc.  With this attempt my goal is to incorperate software
engineering elements such as design artifacts and testing.

### Use
None yet, purely documentation at this point.
